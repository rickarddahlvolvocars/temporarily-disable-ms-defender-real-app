# Mac app for temporarily disable MS Defender
The intention of this app is to improve the Mac's performance, and in particular Xcode's by disabling MS Defender, which slows down the computer a lot. It's undefined for how long the disabling will hold on, but my tests indicate it will last for days. It will probably enable again after a restart.

The app was created in Automator. You may run the app as is and it will temporarily disable MS Defender's real-time scannings + add some Xcode related processes to the scanning exclusions list.

The app will ask for your password. If you don't know why, please check the source code first :-)

You may open the app in Automator to see the source and modify it to your needs.

Please contribute if you do any improvements!
