# Mac app for temporarily disable MS Defender
The intention of this app is to improve Xcode and the Mac's performance by disabling MS Defender, which slows down the computer a lot.

The app was created in Automator. You may run the app as is and it will temporarily disable MS Defender's real-time scannings + add some Xcode related processes to the scanning exclusions list.

The app will ask for your password. If you don't know why, please check the source code first :-)

You may open the app in Automator to see the source and modify it to your needs.

Please contribute if you do any improvements!
